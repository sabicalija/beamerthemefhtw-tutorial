# A method to configure latexmk to use a custom dependency is to use the subroutines that allow convenient manipulations of the custom dependency list.
# These are
#   add_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension, must, subroutine )
#   remove_cus_dep( fromextension, toextension )
#   show_cus_dep()
# The arguments are as follows:
#  - from extension:
#      The extension of the file we are converting from (e.g. "fig").
#      It is specified without a period.
#  - to extension:
#      The extension of the file we are converting to (e.g. "eps").
#      It is specified without a period.
#  - must:
#      If non-zero, the file from which we are converting must exist, if it doesn't exist latexmk will give an error message and exit unless the -f option is specified.
#      If must is zero and the file we are converting from doesn't exist, then no action is taken.
#      Generally, the appropriate value of must is zero.
#  - function:
#      The name of the subroutine that latexmk should call to perform the file conversion.
#      The first argument to the subroutine is the base name of the file to be converted without any extension.
#      The subroutines are declared in the syntax of Perl.
#      The function should return 0 if it was successful and a nonzero number if it failed.
#  Naturally add_cus_dep adds a custom dependency with the specified from and to extensions.
#  If a custom dependency has been previously defined (e.g., in an rcfile that was read earlier), then it is replaced by the new one.
